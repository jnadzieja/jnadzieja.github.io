    <p>
        Hi I'm Josh. I like long walks on the beach, and the smell of lavender.
        My favorite food is Lo Mein, and my favorite movie is Fight Club. <br>
        I have 5 siblings, and that makes remembering birthdays annoying. But they're all pretty cool.
        Also buying that many birthday gifts per year <br>
        makes me pretty much permanently broke, but that's alright I guess.
    </p>
